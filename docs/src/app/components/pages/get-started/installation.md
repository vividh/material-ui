## Installation

Material-UI is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/material-ui).

### Roboto Font

Material-UI was designed with the [Roboto](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto)
font in mind.
So be sure to include it in your project.
Here are [some instructions](http://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto:400,300,500)
on how to do so.

### ES Compiling

The examples in this documentation use the ```stage-1``` features of the ECMAScript specification. Be sure if you are testing these examples in your own project that you have the proper plugins installed in your compiler. Here are [some instructions](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-1/) on how to install the plugin for Babel.
